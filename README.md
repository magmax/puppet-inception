# Puppet quick start project

The idea is to start using puppet in 2 minutes.

## Quick start

1. Download this repository
2. Run `./inception.sh`

Boom! That's it.


## Next steps

3. Edit the `Puppetfile` file to add those modules you want to download
4. The `inception.sh` script should have created the file `data/[HOSTNAME].yaml`. Edit it to add more packages to your host.
5. Repeat from step 2.

From now on, you should be able to manage everything just editing [yaml] files.
